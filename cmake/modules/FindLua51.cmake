# Locate Lua library
# This module defines
#  LUA51_FOUND, if false, do not try to link to Lua 
#  LUA_LIBRARIES
#  LUA_INCLUDE_DIR, where to find lua.h 
#
# Note that the expected include convention is
#  #include "lua.h"
# and not
#  #include <lua/lua.h>
# This is because, the lua location is not standardized and may exist
# in locations other than lua/
